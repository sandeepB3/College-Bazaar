# College Bazaar
Buying and selling in college - A student community-based marketplace for all the needs of students. <br>

It's a marketplace for the reselling of used products. For example, a huge number of students pass out every year in college and they are replaced by freshers. Pass-outs leave behind their stuff like bicycles, notes, etc. which could be extremely useful for new students. Such a platform could be used to trade general items too so that students can develop better connectivity and relations among themselves.
